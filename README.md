# Flight Booker

## Overview

Project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker) as part of the Advanced Forms and Active Record section of the Ruby on Rails course.

Through this project we were tasked with building a website which allows users to book one-way flights. The typical booking flow consists of: (1) Entering the desired dates/airports and searching, (2) Choosing from among a list of availble flights, and (3) Enterting passender information for all passengers.
